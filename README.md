JSON Library
============

The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) language is a small, simple representation for storing and transmitting structured data, for example over a network connection. It is most commonly used to transfer data from a web service to a browser-based JavaScript application.

Here you will find a small, but complete, Haskell library. This library will manipulate and serialize data in a JSON form.
